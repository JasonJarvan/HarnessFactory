# longterm-solo.md Template

## Document Meta

- Repository:
- Effective From:
- Source Template:
  - `harness-stack/assets/templates/longterm/solo.md`
- Recipe Reference:
  - pick from `harness-stack/assets/templates/recipes/`; default solo combo is
    `superpowers` when short-lived, `superpowers-repomem` when long-lived
- Last Updated Because:

## Current Long-Term Assessment

- Collaboration Scale:
  - `solo`
- Repository Type:
  - `product | research | platform | other`
- Project Horizon:
  - `short-lived | long-lived`
- Long-Term Knowledge Governance:
  - `enabled | disabled`

## Current Active Long-Term Baseline

### 1. Primary Workflow Layer

- Default enabled:
  - none by default
- Emergent Ownership:
  - Superpowers brainstorming and writing-plans carry primary workflow
    responsibility for solo work. If OpenSpec is added per task, the change
    cycle joins this responsibility.
- Default inactive:
  - `BMAD`
  - `gstack`
  - `GSD`
- Upgrade trigger:
  - repository enters long-lived roadmap-heavy mode
  - task portfolio becomes too large for execution-only discipline

### 2. Spec Layer

- Default enabled:
  - none by default
- Default inactive:
  - `OpenSpec`
- Upgrade trigger:
  - requirements need explicit change boundaries
  - delivery target reaches `MVP` or above
  - task risk or scope makes chat-only agreement unsafe

### 3. Execution Discipline Layer

- Default enabled:
  - `Superpowers`
- Default inactive:
  - none by default
- Upgrade trigger:
  - increase verification and review intensity when risk rises

### 4. Repository Memory Layer

- Default enabled:
  - `RepoMem` when repository is long-lived
- Default inactive:
  - `RepoMem` when repository is short-lived and disposable
- Upgrade trigger:
  - repository knowledge starts accumulating across tasks
  - architecture and decision memory need persistence

### 5. Harness Enhancement Layer

- Default enabled:
  - `ECC(light)` when memory, hooks, or verification loops are useful
- Default inactive:
  - `ECC`
- Upgrade trigger:
  - agent context quality, safety, or repeatability becomes a recurring problem

## Pipeline

- Pull from the recipe chosen via `Recipe Reference`. Solo with no recipe
  reference defaults to a Superpowers-driven sequence: brainstorming →
  writing-plans → using-git-worktrees → executing-plans / TDD →
  verification-before-completion → requesting-code-review →
  finishing-a-development-branch.

## Cross-Layer Conflicts

- N/A in the default solo recipe (single-layer execution).
- If a recipe adds OpenSpec or RepoMem, pull conflicts from that recipe.

## Verification Topology

- Superpowers.verification-before-completion is the single verification entry
  by default. If OpenSpec is added, OpenSpec.verify runs alongside.

## Merge Gates

- Default solo has no merge gate. If RepoMem is added, RepoMem.merge becomes
  HITL after task completion.

## Suitability Envelope

### Fits

- one active contributor
- mixed short-lived and long-lived work

### Does Not Fit

- multi-contributor coordination
- strict cross-team governance requirements

## Temporary Contractor Boundary Rules

### Temporary Contractor May Adjust

- add or skip `OpenSpec` for the current task
- raise or lower `Superpowers` intensity
- enable or disable lightweight `ECC` for the task

### Temporary Contractor May Not Override

- the existence of long-term repository memory once enabled
- long-term governance and safety constraints
- this document's collaboration-scale assumption without full rewrite

## Full Rewrite Conditions

- repository moves from solo to team collaboration
- repository becomes clearly long-lived after initially being short-lived
- default primary workflow needs to become permanently heavier
